/* To create a personal library, one must:

1. Create a Header file containing the interface info for a program needing the library (What the functions will do)
2 Create an implementation file container code of the library functions and other details of implementation hidden from user program. (How they will do it)
3. Compile the implementation file. This step must be repeated any time either the header file or the implementation file is revised. 

To Use:
1. Include the libraryâ€™s header file in the user program through an #include directive.
2. After compiling the user program, include both its object file and the object file created in step 3 above in the command that activates the linker.
